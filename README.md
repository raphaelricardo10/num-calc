# Numerical Methods
Universidade Veiga de Almeida 
Numerical Analysis

This is my first python project.
I had to implement some numerical methods with pencil and paper and test them manually.
However, I questioned my professor if I could implement it in Python because I just started learning it and it could be much more productive in this way.

With this project, I learned how to read, interpret and present data with numpy, matplotlib and pandas.
I loved the experience and it motivated me to study python even more. After this project, I realized that this is what I want to do in my career.
Some months later, I started a free course about machine learning in Intel Developer Zone website.
